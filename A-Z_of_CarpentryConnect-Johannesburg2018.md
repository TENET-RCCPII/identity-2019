### D: Diversity, Data Carpentry

#### Diversity

The Carpentries is a community of volunteer instructors, helpers, Trainers, Maintainers, champions, member organisations, supporters, and staff, of diverse background, nationality, ethnicity, gender and various identity groups. We are working hard to ensure that everyone feels welcome at CarpentryCon. Feel free to reach out to the organizers and staff if they can improve your experience as a member at The Carpentries and CarpentryCon. Attendees must be prepared to abide by our Code of Conduct (see *Allies, Carpentries, Code of Conduct, Inclusion, Emergency*).

#### Data Carpentry

[Data Carpentry (DC)](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) provides researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. There will be an information desk where you can collect information on DC team, their work, workshops and various ways to get involved with their activities. Additionally, several DC members will be attending CarpentryCon (you can identify them by their badge), giving participants an opportunity for face-to-face networking.


### E: Executives, Emergency, Etherpads, Entertainment, Events, Exhibition

### H: Helpers and Helpdesk


#### Helpers

Helpers are volunteers from the community who join our workshops and circulate between participants to ensure everyone follows the hands-on sessions and are assisted when technical difficulty arrise. Helpers are critical allies of the instructors and ensure challenges experienced in the classroom are relayed back to the instructor in a timeous manner. A Carpentry workshop is heavily dependent on our helpers, just as much as our instructors.


#### Helpdesk

We will not have an official helpdesk at the event, but you can get assistance in the workshops from instructors and helpers. Every workshop has at least 4 - 6 or more instructors and helpers who will be introduced at the beginning of the event. Please ensure you know who they are and feel free to ask them for help with anything you may need during the event.

Alternatively, please contact the conference organisers at carpentryconnect-jhb-2018@googlegroups.com.



### I: Icebreaker, Inclusion

#### Icebreaker

Each workshop's instructors and helpers will help workshop participants to meet others in the room through group work early on in the workshop. Everybody at the event has a lot in common in terms of challenges to learn and teach computational and digital skills. We hope that the breaks will provide you with opportunities to meet colleagues from other institutions to grow your own network.


#### Inclusion

We want to create an inclusive and welcoming environment at the conference. We are providing travel assistance to facilitate attendance from as wide a group as possible. We are collecting full details to identify needs for mobility, accessibility and dietary preferences during registration. Feel free to reach out to the organizers and staff if they can improve your participation at CarpentryCon. (see *Allies, Carpentries, Code of Conduct, Diversity, Emergency*)


### J: Join the Carpentries

#### Join the Carpentries

There are several ways to become a member of [The Carpentries community](https://carpentries.org/community/) and support its work. At CarpentryConnect, there will be opportunities to meet volunteers from the community to learn more about it. See [here](https://carpentries.org/join/) for more detail.

### K: Keynote Speakers, Knowledge sharing

#### Keynote Speakers

This event is slightly different from your typical conference as it will consist of full-day, hands-on workshops rather than talks and presentations.

We don't have keynote speakers, but we do have over 20 instructors and helpers. You can learn more about our instructors' and helpers' backgrounds and experience on the <a href="http://carpentryconnectza.org/">CarpentryConnect website</a> under Trainers.

#### Knowledge sharing

We are privileged to have a very diverse group of participants, instructors and helpers at CarpentryConnect. Please take the opportunity to learn from each other. If you need a breakout room on Thursday morning (not participating in the instructor training) or on Wednesday afternoon, to discuss specific topics in small groups, please contact Anelda van der Walt as soon as possible to arrange.


### L: Library Carpentry

#### Library Carpentry

Library Carpentry, is made by librarians, for librarians to help you automate repetitive, boring, error-prone tasks, create, maintain and analyse sustainable and reusable data, work effectively with IT and systems colleagues, better understand the use of software in research and much more. Library Carpentry introduces you to the fundamentals of computing and provides you with a platform for further self-directed learning. See [here](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/our-sponsors/) for more detail. 


### M: Medical, Mentoring

#### Medical

Too be completed shortly

#### Mentoring

Mentorship is an important part of the Carpentry experience. As Instructors, we both teach and mentor our Learners. We also mentor each other as Instructors, learning something new from each other every time we teach and interact with one another. The Mentoring Subcommittee offers guidance to new and continuing Instructors through weekly discussion sessions, where Instructors from the global Carpentry community gather to share their experiences and learn from each other. This is a fantastic opportunity to interact with other Carpentry Instructors from around the world. (Read more on the The Carpentries [Blog1](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/mentoring-wrap-up.html) and [Blog2](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/03/next-round-mentoring.html)) and [Blog3](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/08/sign-up-mentoring/).



### N: New Members, Name Tags

#### New Members

Are you new to The Carpentries? Do you want to learn more about the organization and how you can support it? CarpentryConnect Johannesburg is the place for you. Actually a **_better_** start for you than the rest of us had, as you will have an opportunity for face-to-face networking and interaction. We understand that it could be frightening if you don't know anyone, but the community has a history of being very friendly and inclusive, so don't be afraid to say 'Hi' and introduce yourself. You will be surprised how many lasting collaborations you will make at the conference.

### S: Sticky Notes, Special requirements, Surveys, Sponsors, Software Carpentry


#### Sticky Notes

We love sticky notes! No Carpentries workshop is possible without the sticky notes. See [Greg's collection of tips and techniques for teaching with sticky notes](https://github.com/gvwilson/sticky-note-teaching) to learn the various reasons it makes learning and teaching easier. Therefore, we will be using (even over-using!) these during the skill-up sessions, workshops and wherever possible.


#### Special requirements

We want to assist you in all possible ways to make your participation at CarpentryConnect enjoyable and stress-free. Please contact the organisers with any requests for special needs so that we can make arrangements before your arrival. Do not hesitate to contact us during the meeting for any help. 

#### Surveys

To be added shortly

#### Sponsors

CarpentryConnect Johannesburg 2018 is co-funded by the:

* [Rural Campuses Connection Project II](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/rccpii-2018/) (RCCPII), a DHET funded project administered by Universities South Africa (USAF) and implemented by The Tertiary Education and Research Network (TENET)  AND
* [South African Centre for Digital Language Resources](https://www.sadilar.org/) (SADiLaR), a DST funded project that forms part of the South African Research Infrastructure Roadmap (SARIR).


#### Software Carpentry

The Software Carpentry Foundation and its sibling project, Data Carpentry, have merged to become The Carpentries. Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. Our volunteer instructors have run hundreds of events for more than 34,000 researchers since 2012. All of our lesson materials are freely reusable under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

Like *Data Carpentry*, we will have a desk at the conference where you can learn more about this project.


### T: Taskforce, Twitter, Technical Support, Travel/Transportation

#### TaskForce

The [African Carpentries Task Force](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/regional_communities/african_task_force.html) was established late in 2017 to help grow the Carpentries in Africa through mentorship and support for local instructors.

#### Twitter

The Carpentries can be followed on Twitter at @TheCarpentries](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries) whereas the individual lesson organisations, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, as well as Library Carpentry, can be followed respectively at [https://twitter.com/swcarpentry](https://twitter.com/swcarpentry), [https://twitter.com/datacarpentry](https://twitter.com/datacarpentry), and [https://twitter.com/LibCarpentry](https://twitter.com/LibCarpentry).


#### Technical Support

We'll do our best to provide technical support during the workshop in collaboration with our helpers, and the conference venue staff. Please approach a helper if you have any technical challenges. Helpers will be introduced at the beginning of the workshops.


#### Travel/Transportation

Travel should be arranged by you or your institution. Conference organisers are not liable for making any transport arrangements. 

It is advised to fly to OR Tambo rather than Lanseria Airport as the venue is only a few minutes away from OR Tambo and a [free shuttle](https://bit.ly/2w70GdO) run between OR Tambo and the venue/hotel daily.
