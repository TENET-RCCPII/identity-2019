                <td><a href="https://allegravia.github.io/website/about/">Dr. Allegra Via</a> is a physicist and scientific researcher at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Pathology (IBPM) of the National Research Council (CNR, Rome, IT). She is involved in the design, organisation and delivery of bioinformatics training courses, in Train the Trainer activities, and collaborate with other ELIXIR’s nodes on many training-related initiatives. She has a long track record of academic teaching (Macromolecular Structures, Python programming, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Protein interactions). Allegra's main research interests include protein structural bioinformatics, protein structure and function prediction and analysis, and protein interactions. She's also strongly interested in what researchers have discovered about how people learn and how best to teach them, and how research findings in the science of learning (educational psychology) can be translated into common teaching practice.

                <td>Samar is a PhD candidate in Bioinformatics at the Computational Biology Group, University of Cape Town. Her research interest is in predicting the genetic risk of brain diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and glioblastoma brain tumour. To achieve this, she develops data analysis pipelines, as well as model-based statistical approaches, that integrate genome-wide variation with several brain imaging features and investigate their relationships. She writes her codes in R, python, shell scripting and uses various open source bioinformatics tools. Samar is enthusiastic about teaching researchers the basics of statistics and programming skills. She joined the Carpentries team and became an instructor in 2017, and since then, she got involved in teaching and organising several Carpentries workshops, including the first Software Carpentry workshop in Sudan. </td>

I would like to learn more about in-silico gene editing as an avenue to cure genetic diseases search as cancer and sickle cell. My spare time involves teaching anything I have learned about systems, programming, web development and data analysis. Before joining the Carpentries, I founded and led the Mozilla Community in Uganda for 5 exciting and productive years. When I’m not at my computer, I spend time reading, exercising and playing the music keyboard.</td>

Dr. Brown received her BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University. Dr Brown builds machine learning tools that bridge from data-agnostic methods to systems that fuel data driven discovery in historically qualitative domains. Her work approaches this from two fronts: building interfaces that enable my algorithms to leverage domain scientists' qualitative expertise and developing model-based machine learning solutions through close collaboration with domain scientists. Sarah has been an instructor with The Carpentries since November 2017 serves as a member of the Lesson Infrastructure Committee. Currently she serves as treasurer and previously as a workshop organizer for Women In Machine Learning, Inc.

Although I never though of myself as a teacher, I have found myself enjoying teaching in the various Carpentries, and what began as a means to close the gap between what researchers need and what the support IT brings to the table, has grown into a full-on passion to teach people, to better equip those who do not even know yet of what is available to them as streamlined methods and tools. In 2018 I was fortunate enough to be part of the world-first Carpentry Con in Dublin and have since taught in a few carpentries, as well as assisting where I can. Ironically the tools we teach researchers are so applicable to situations outside of research that I was able to adapt it to my current working environment and a lot of people, even outside of my professional circle, was able to adapt these tools similarly. I am thrilled and honored to be part of the Carpentries family!</td>
